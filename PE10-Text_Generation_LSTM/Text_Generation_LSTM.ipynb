    "# Summary of Findings on Temperature-based Text Generation\n",
    "\n",
    "The text generation using LSTM models is greatly influenced by the temperature parameter, which controls the randomness of predictions. During our experiments over 60 epochs with sampling temperatures of [0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 1.2], distinct behaviors in the generated text were observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "At **temperature=0.2**, the model was highly conservative. The generated sequences were repetitive and deterministic. Often, it kept looping similar words or phrases with little variation. Although the grammar and structure were more coherent, it lacked creativity. This is because lower temperature values make the model strongly favor high-probability characters, essentially removing randomness from sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "At **temperature=0.5**, the results showed improvement in diversity while maintaining grammatical consistency. The sentences had more variation and appeared less robotic. It struck a good balance between coherence and novelty, making it one of the optimal values for realistic text generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "With **temperature=1.0**, the model exhibited significant creativity. The words were more unpredictable and the vocabulary used was broader. However, this came at the cost of occasional grammatical errors or odd word formations. Nevertheless, the model captured some stylistic flair that wasn't present at lower temperatures.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the extreme end, **temperature=1.2** produced very erratic outputs. The generated text had frequent inconsistencies, non-words, and broke the rules of grammar more often. Still, it offered a glimpse into the depth of the model's learned vocabulary and potential for poetic or abstract writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, these results confirm that the temperature setting directly affects how deterministic or creative the output is. A lower temperature makes the model risk-averse and repetitive, while a higher one injects randomness that can lead to both novelty and chaos. For applications like chatbots or fiction writing, a moderate value like 0.5 to 1.0 offers the best trade-off. For generating highly accurate or technical content, lower values may be preferable.\n",
    "\n",
    "This temperature-tuning experiment emphasizes the importance of sampling strategy in sequence generation and how it allows practitioners to control the behavior of generative models depending on the application domain.\n",
